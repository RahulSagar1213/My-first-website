			<h1>Object Oriented Programming:</h1>
			<p>Object Oriented Programming is a programming language based on the concept of object and class in which data in form of field often known as attributes and code in form of procedure often known as methods. Object Oriented Programming is based on buttom-up approach and program also provide access specifiers like private, public and protected. So, data hiding is possible in object oriented programming and data are secure. It also allows overloading and based on the real world problems. The basic concept of Object Oriented Programming are inheritance, data abstraction, encapsulation and polymorphism.</p>

		<h2>Object:</h2>
		<p>Object are basic run-time entities in object oriented system.Object are member variables of class which are userdefined datatype.<br>
			Example:
		<pre style="font-size: 15px;">
		<em>Class example{
                       Acces specicier:
                       Member function and data members;			             
                     };
		void main(){
   					Example p1;  //p1 is object
					}
</em>
		</pre>
		Program problem can be analysed in term of object and the nature of communication between them. Program is choosen such that they closely match with real world data. Object take up space in memory and have an associated address like structure and union in C. When program is executed, object interact by sending message to one another with class related with it.
		</p>
		<h2>Class:</h2>
<p>Class is an user-defined datatype that allows us to group activites and action together. In other words, class is a collection of objects of similar type which are also userdefined datatype and behaves like built in type in programming language. Once class has been  defined, we can create any number of objects associated with that class.
	<pre style="font-size: 15px;">
		<ins>Syntax:</ins><em>
          Class class_name {
                                    Acess specifier:
                                            Data member and member function;
                             };
